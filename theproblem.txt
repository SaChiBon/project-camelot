Facebook is a terrible platform to share photos
- difficult to have multiple collaborators on albums
- permissions for different people is a pain
- can't easily download an entire album
- extra junk (political posts, platform for the worst of humanity)

Instagram doesn't do what I want
- good to show your highlight reel to random people
- bad for sharing family photos
